name: "ART05 - Read File: Retrieve Content Integrity"
priority: Critical
description: |
  Verify that readFile correctly retrieves file content with proper encoding and formatting.
  
  Objective: Test complete file retrieval with multi-line content and special characters
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - File content is retrieved completely
  - Line breaks are preserved
  - Special characters are intact
  - Content matches exactly what was written

          Analyze the file read result to verify content integrity.
          
          Tool executed: readFile
          Filename: read-test-${TIMESTAMP}.txt
          Expected content: 4 lines with special characters and unicode
          Read result: {read_result}
          
          Expected behavior:
          - File content is retrieved completely
          - All 4 lines are present
          - Line breaks are preserved
          - Special characters (@#$%) are intact
          - Unicode characters (é in café) are preserved
          - No truncation or corruption
          
          Evaluate:
          1. Is the file content present in the result?
          2. Do all 4 lines appear in the result?
          3. Are special characters preserved correctly?
          4. Are line breaks preserved?
          5. Is unicode content intact?
          6. Is there any error or empty content?
          
          Return a JSON object with:

            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
