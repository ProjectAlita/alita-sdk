priority: High
description: |
  Verify that deleteFile correctly removes files from bucket.
  
  Objective: Test file deletion and verification of removal
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - File is deleted successfully
  - File no longer appears in file listing
  - Attempting to read deleted file returns error
  - Deletion operation completes without errors

  # Verification using readFile instead of listFiles for more robust deletion check.
  # Why readFile verification is superior:
  # 1. Direct verification - Tests actual behavior (file cannot be accessed after deletion)
  # 2. No JSON parsing complexity - Simple string checks for success/error indicators
  # 3. No scaling issues - Works with 1 file or 10,000 files in bucket
  # 4. Stronger guarantee - File is truly inaccessible, not just "missing from a list"
  # 5. Simpler context - LLM only sees 3 small strings, not 185-file listings

          Analyze the deletion workflow results to verify the file was properly deleted.
          
          Tool execution: readFile (before) → deleteFile → readFile (after)
          File being tested: {filename}
          
          Read before delete: {read_before_result}
          Delete operation: {delete_result}
          Read after delete: {read_after_result}
          
          Expected behavior:
          - File must be readable before deletion (read_before_result should NOT contain errors)
          - Delete operation must succeed (delete_result should indicate success)
          - File must NOT be readable after deletion (read_after_result MUST contain error/not found)
          
          Evaluate:
          1. Was the file accessible before deletion?
          2. Did the delete operation succeed?
          3. Is the file inaccessible after deletion (read returns error)?
          4. Are there any unexpected errors?
          
          Return a JSON object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of deletion operation",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
