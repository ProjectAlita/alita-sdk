name: "ART06 - Read File Chunk: Partial Read by Line Range"
priority: High
description: |
  Verify that read_file_chunk correctly reads specific line ranges from files.
  
  Objective: Test partial file reading with start_line and end_line parameters
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Specified line range is returned
  - Lines outside range are not included
  - Line numbering is 1-indexed and inclusive
  - Content within range is accurate

          Analyze the partial file read result (line 2-4 from 5-line file).
          
          Tool executed: read_file_chunk
          Filename: chunk-test-${TIMESTAMP}.txt
          Requested range: lines 2-4 (inclusive)
          Expected content: Lines containing "Second", "Third", "Fourth"
          Result: {chunk_result}
          
          Expected behavior:
          - Only lines 2-4 are returned
          - Line 1 and Line 5 are NOT included
          - Content is accurate for requested range
          - Line breaks are preserved
          - No error messages
          
          Evaluate:
          1. Does result contain lines 2-4?
          2. Does result exclude lines 1 and 5?
          3. Are the line contents correct (Second, Third, Fourth)?
          4. Are line breaks preserved?
          5. Is there any error?
          
          Return a JSON object with:
          {{

            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
