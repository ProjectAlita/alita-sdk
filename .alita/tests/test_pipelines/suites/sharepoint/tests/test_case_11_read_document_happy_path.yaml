          analyze the output from the 'read_document' tool execution.

          tool executed: read_document (after uploading test file)
          upload result: {upload_result}
          document content: {document_content}
          error indicators: {error_indicators}

          expected behavior:
          - file was uploaded successfully
          - read_document executes successfully without errors
          - returns file content (string or structured data)
          - content is not empty
          - no error messages in output

          evaluate:
          1. was the file uploaded successfully?
          2. did the read_document tool execute successfully?
          3. are there any error indicators in the output?
          4. is content returned (not null or empty)?
          5. is the content in expected format?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
