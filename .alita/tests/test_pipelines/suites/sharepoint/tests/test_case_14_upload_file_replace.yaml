description: |
  Verify the SharePoint 'upload_file' tool replaces an existing file when replace=True.
  
  Objective: Test file replacement functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - First upload creates the file successfully
  - Second upload with replace=True overwrites the existing file
  - No errors occur during replacement
  - Final file contains updated content

          analyze the outputs from two consecutive 'upload_file' tool executions to verify file replacement.

          tool executed: upload_file (twice)
          filename: {filename}
          first upload result: {first_upload_result}
          second upload result: {second_upload_result}

          expected behavior:
          - both uploads execute successfully without errors
          - first upload creates the file
          - second upload replaces the existing file
          - both results contain valid file metadata
          - no errors during replacement operation

          evaluate:
          1. did both uploads execute successfully?
          2. are there any error messages in either output?
          3. do both results contain required fields (id, webUrl, path)?
          4. does the second upload indicate successful replacement?
          5. are both file paths identical?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown, no additional text.
