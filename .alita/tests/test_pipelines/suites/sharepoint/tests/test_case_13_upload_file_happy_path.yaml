          analyze the output from the 'upload_file' tool execution.

          tool executed: upload_file
          filename: {filename}
          folder path: {folder_path}
          results: {upload_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - returns object with file metadata
          - response contains id, webUrl, path, size, and mime_type fields
          - path includes the target folder and filename
          - no error messages in output

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any error messages in the output?
          3. does the result contain required fields (id, webUrl, path, size, mime_type)?
          4. is the id a valid value?
          5. does the path contain the expected filename?
          6. is the size a positive number?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown, no additional text.

    output:
