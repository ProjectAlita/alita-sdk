description: |
  Verify the Bitbucket 'delete_branch' tool deletes an existing branch successfully.

  Objective: Test successful branch deletion

  Expected Behavior:
  - Branch is created successfully for testing
  - Branch is deleted without errors
  - Branch no longer appears in repository branch list
  - Appropriate success message is returned
  - No error indicators in output

          Analyze the output from the 'delete_branch' tool execution.

          Branch Name: {branch_name}
          Create Result: {create_result}
          Branch List Before Deletion: {branch_list_before}
          Delete Result: {delete_result}
          Branch List After Deletion: {branch_list_after}
          Expected Success Indicators: {expected_success_indicators}
          Error Indicators: {error_indicators}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful branch deletion.

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. tool_executed: All tools ran and returned results
          2. branch_created: Branch was created successfully
          3. branch_in_list_before: Branch appeared in list before deletion
          4. no_errors: Delete result does NOT contain any error indicators
          5. deletion_success: Delete result indicates success (contains success indicator)
          6. branch_not_in_list_after: Branch name does NOT appear in the branch list after deletion

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "tool_executed": boolean,
            "branch_created": boolean,
            "branch_in_list_before": boolean,
            "no_errors": boolean,
            "deletion_success": boolean,
            "branch_not_in_list_after": boolean,
            "success_indicator_found": "which indicator was found or 'none'",
            "error_indicator_found": "which error indicator was found or 'none'",
            "branches_found_after": [list of branch names from branch_list_after],
            "error": string | null
          }}

          Return ONLY the JSON object.
