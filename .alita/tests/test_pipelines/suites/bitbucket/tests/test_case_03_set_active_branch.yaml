name: "BB03 - set_active_branch: Switch to existing branch"
description: |
  Verify the Bitbucket 'set_active_branch' tool successfully switches to an existing branch.

  Objective: Test branch switching functionality

  Expected Behavior:
  - Branch is created successfully for testing
  - Switching between branches works correctly
  - Active branch is properly updated
  - No errors during switch operations

  - id: ${BITBUCKET_TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${BITBUCKET_TOOLKIT_NAME}

          Analyze the output from 'set_active_branch' tool execution.

          Switch to Test Branch ({test_branch_name}): {switch_result}
          Files Listed (verify branch context): {files_in_active_branch}
          Expected Switch Indicators: {expected_switch_indicators}
          Error Indicators: {error_indicators}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful branch switching.

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. switch_success: Switch to test branch contains success indicator
          2. no_errors: No error indicators in output
          3. files_listed: File listing succeeded (confirms active branch is valid)

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "switch_success": boolean,
            "no_errors": boolean,
            "files_listed": boolean,
            "switch_indicator_found": "which indicator was found or 'none'",
            "error_indicator_found": "which error indicator was found or 'none'",
            "error": string | null
          }}

          Return ONLY the JSON object.
