  Verify the Bitbucket 'read_file' tool correctly reads file contents.

  Objective: Test file reading with special characters and line breaks

  Expected Behavior:
  - File content is read completely
  - Special characters are preserved
  - Line breaks are maintained
  - Content matches exactly (byte-for-byte)

          Analyze the output from the 'read_file' tool execution.

          Create Result: {create_result}
          Read Content: {file_content}
          Expected Content: {test_content}
          Cleanup Result: {cleanup_result}
          Branch Cleanup Result: {cleanup_branch_result}
          Expected Line Count: {expected_line_count}
          Expected Special Characters: {expected_special_chars}
          Error Indicators: {error_indicators}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful file reading with exact content match.

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. file_created: File was created successfully
          2. no_read_errors: Read operation has no error indicators
          3. exact_match: Read content EXACTLY matches expected content (including whitespace)
          4. line_count_correct: Number of lines matches expected ({expected_line_count})
          5. special_chars_preserved: ALL special characters are present in read content
          6. newlines_preserved: Line breaks are maintained correctly
          7. branch_cleanup_successful: Test branch was deleted successfully

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "file_created": boolean,
            "no_read_errors": boolean,
            "exact_match": boolean,
            "line_count_correct": boolean,
            "special_chars_preserved": boolean,
            "newlines_preserved": boolean,

            "actual_line_count": number,
            "missing_special_chars": [list of missing special chars],
            "content_length_expected": number (length of expected content),
            "content_length_actual": number (length of read content),
            "error": string | null
