name: "BB09 - read_file: Read existing file from main branch"
description: |
  Verify the Bitbucket 'read_file' tool correctly reads file contents from the main branch.

  Objective: Test file reading with line breaks and content validation

  Expected Behavior:
  - File content is read completely from main branch
  - Line breaks are maintained
  - Content matches exactly (byte-for-byte)

toolkits:
  - id: ${BITBUCKET_TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${BITBUCKET_TOOLKIT_NAME}

state:
  branch_name:
    type: str
    value: main
  error_indicators:
    type: list
    value:
      - error
      - not found
      - '404'
      - permission denied
      - failed to read
  expected_line_count:
    type: int
    value: 3
  file_content:
    type: str
  expected_content:
    type: str
    value: |
      Line 1: This is the original content
      Line 2: This line will be referenced
      Line 3: This is the end

          Analyze the output from the 'read_file' tool execution.

          Read Content: {file_content}
          Expected Content: {expected_content}
          Expected Line Count: {expected_line_count}
          Error Indicators: {error_indicators}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful file reading with exact content match.

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. no_read_errors: Read operation has no error indicators
          2. exact_match: Read content EXACTLY matches expected content (including whitespace)
          3. line_count_correct: Number of lines matches expected ({expected_line_count})
          4. newlines_preserved: Line breaks are maintained correctly

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "no_read_errors": boolean,
            "exact_match": boolean,
            "line_count_correct": boolean,
            "newlines_preserved": boolean,
            "actual_line_count": number,
            "content_length_expected": number (length of expected content),
            "content_length_actual": number (length of read content),
            "error": string | null
          }}

          Return ONLY the JSON object.
