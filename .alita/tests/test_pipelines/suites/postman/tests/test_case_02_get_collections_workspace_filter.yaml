  Validates that get_collections properly filters collections by workspace when
  the workspace_id is configured in the toolkit settings.
  
  Objective: Verify workspace filtering functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully
  - Returns collections specific to the configured workspace
  - Response is valid JSON with collection metadata

toolkits:
  - id: ${TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${TOOLKIT_NAME}

state:
  tool_result:
    type: dict
  test_results:
    type: dict
entry_point: invoke_get_collections
nodes:
  - id: invoke_get_collections

    type: toolkit

    tool: get_collections

    toolkit_name: ${TOOLKIT_NAME}

    input: []

    input_mapping: {}

    output:

      - tool_result

    structured_output: true

    transition: process_results

      task:

          Analyze the output from the 'get_collections' tool with workspace filtering.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that get_collections correctly applies workspace filtering.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the response is valid JSON.
          3. Check that collections data is present.
          4. Validate the structure includes workspace-related information if available.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if workspace-filtered collections were retrieved),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
