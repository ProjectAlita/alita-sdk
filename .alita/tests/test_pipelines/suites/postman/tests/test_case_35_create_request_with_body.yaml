          Analyze the output from the 'create_request' tool for POST request with body.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that create_request creates a POST request with body and headers.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the POST request was created with body.
          3. Check that headers and body were properly set.
          4. Validate the complete request structure.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if POST request was created with body),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
