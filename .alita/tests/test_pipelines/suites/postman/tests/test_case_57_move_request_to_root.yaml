  Validates that the move_request tool can move a request to the root level
  of the collection (not inside any folder).
  
  Objective: Verify moving request to collection root
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully
  - Request is moved to collection root
  - Request becomes a top-level item
  - Returns confirmation of the move

  - id: ${TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${TOOLKIT_NAME}

  target_folder_path:
    type: str
    value: null

      task:
        type: fstring
        value: |
          Analyze the output from the 'move_request' tool for moving to root.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that move_request can move a request to collection root.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the request was moved to root level.
          3. Check for success confirmation.
          4. Validate the request is now a top-level item.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if request was moved to root successfully),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
