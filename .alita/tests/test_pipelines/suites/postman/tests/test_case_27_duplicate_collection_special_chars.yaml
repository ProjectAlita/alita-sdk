  Validates that the duplicate_collection tool properly handles collection names
  containing special characters and Unicode.
  
  Objective: Verify handling of special characters in collection names
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully
  - Special characters in name are preserved
  - Collection copy is created with the exact name
  - No character encoding issues

toolkits:
  - id: ${TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${TOOLKIT_NAME}

state:
  tool_result:
    type: dict
  test_results:
    type: dict
  new_name:
    type: str
    value: "Test Collection (Copy) #1 - 测试"
entry_point: invoke_duplicate_collection

nodes:
  - id: invoke_duplicate_collection
    type: toolkit
    toolkit_name: ${TOOLKIT_NAME}
    tool: duplicate_collection
    input:
      - new_name
    input_mapping:
      new_name:
        type: variable
        value: new_name
    output:

      task:

          Analyze the output from the 'duplicate_collection' tool with special characters.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that duplicate_collection handles special characters in names.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the collection was duplicated.
          3. Check that special characters were preserved in the name.
          4. Validate no encoding or character issues occurred.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if collection was duplicated with special chars),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
