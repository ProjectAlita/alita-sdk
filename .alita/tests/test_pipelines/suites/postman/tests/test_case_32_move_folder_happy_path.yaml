          Analyze the output from the 'move_folder' tool.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that move_folder moves a folder to a new location.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the result indicates folder was moved.
          3. Check for success confirmation or updated collection structure.
          4. Validate the folder is now at the target location.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if folder was moved successfully),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
