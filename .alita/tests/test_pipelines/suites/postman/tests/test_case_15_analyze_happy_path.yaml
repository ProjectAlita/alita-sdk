  Validates that the analyze tool successfully analyzes a collection for API
  quality, best practices, and potential issues.
  
  Objective: Verify collection-level analysis functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully
  - Returns analysis report for the collection
  - Includes quality metrics and best practice checks
  - Identifies potential issues or improvements

          Analyze the output from the 'analyze' tool for collection analysis.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that analyze returns collection quality analysis.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the result contains analysis information.
          3. Check for quality metrics or best practice assessments.
          4. Validate the analysis covers collection-level aspects.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if collection analysis was generated),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
