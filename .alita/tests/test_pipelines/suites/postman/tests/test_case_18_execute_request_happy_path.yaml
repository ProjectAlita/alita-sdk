  Validates that the execute_request tool successfully executes a Postman request
  with environment variables and custom configuration.
  
  Objective: Verify request execution functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes the specified request
  - Environment variables are properly resolved
  - Returns HTTP response details (status, headers, body)
  - Request completes without errors

      task:

          Analyze the output from the 'execute_request' tool.
          
          Tool Result: {tool_result}
          
          This test validates that execute_request executes a request and returns response.
          
          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully.
          2. Verify the result contains HTTP response information.
          3. Check for response status code, headers, or body.
          4. Validate that the request was actually executed.
          
          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:
          
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if request was executed successfully),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}
          
          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no additional text.
