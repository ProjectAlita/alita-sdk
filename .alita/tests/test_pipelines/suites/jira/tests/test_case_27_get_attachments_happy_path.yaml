  Verify `get_attachments_content` tool retrieves attachments from issue.

  Objective: Ensure tool can get attachments from existing issue.

  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully without errors.
  - Returns attachment information or empty list.

          Analyze the output from the 'get_attachments_content' tool.

          Tool Result: {tool_result}

          This tool extracts text content from attachments on a Jira issue.
          IMPORTANT: Only text-parsable attachments (e.g. .txt, .md, .csv) will have non-empty content.
          Binary files such as images (.png, .jpg, .gif) are NOT parsable without an LLM and will have
          empty content arrays (e.g. content: ['']). This is correct and expected behavior.

          Perform the following checks:
          1. Confirm the tool executed successfully — result is not an error message.
          2. If attachments are listed, each entry must have a "filename" field. This is sufficient.
          3. Content may be empty ('') for binary/image files — this is VALID and must NOT cause failure.
          4. Text-based files (e.g. README.md) should have non-empty content if present.
          5. No size, mime-type, or base64 data is expected — the tool does not return these fields.

          Return a JSON object named test_results with the following structure:

          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true if tool executed without error and returned attachment entries with filenames),
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if the tool returned an error or no attachment entries at all, null otherwise"
          }}

          Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown, no additional text.
      chat_history:
        type: fixed
        value: []
    output:
      - test_results
    structured_output_dict:
      test_results: "dict"
    transition: END
