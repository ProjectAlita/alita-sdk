  Verify the Zephyr Essential 'find_folder_by_name' tool finds an existing folder by name.

  Objective: Test folder search by name for "ZephyrEssential" folder

  Expected Behavior:
  - Folder "ZephyrEssential" is found without errors
  - Returns folder with matching name and ID
  - No error indicators in output
  
  Note: This test assumes "ZephyrEssential" folder exists in the project.

          Analyze the output from the 'find_folder_by_name' tool execution.

          Folder Name: {folder_name}
          Find Result: {find_result}
          Expected Success Indicators: {expected_success_indicators}
          Error Indicators: {error_indicators}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful folder search for an existing folder named "ZephyrEssential".

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. tool_executed: Tool ran and returned a result
          2. no_errors: Output does NOT contain any error indicators
          3. folder_found: Folder was found by name
          4. correct_name: Folder name in find result matches "ZephyrEssential" (case-insensitive)
          5. has_id: Result contains folder ID

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "tool_executed": boolean,
