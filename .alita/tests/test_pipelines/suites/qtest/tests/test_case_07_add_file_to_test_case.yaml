name: "QT07 - add_file_to_test_case: Upload file attachment"
description: |
  Verify the QTest 'add_file_to_test_case' tool uploads a file to a test case.

  Objective: Test file attachment upload to test case or test step

  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes without errors
  - File is uploaded successfully
  - Response confirms the attachment
  - No error indicators in output

  Note: This test creates a test case and uploads a text file from artifact storage

          1. Test case was created successfully (has valid TC-xxx ID)
          2. File path was prepared
          3. No critical errors occurred

          Note: This test validates setup for file attachment. Actual file upload requires artifact storage.
