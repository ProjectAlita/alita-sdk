  Verify list_branches_in_repo tool returns branches including expected branch names.
  
  Objective: Confirm the tool can retrieve all branches from the GitLab repository
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully without errors
  - Returns a list of branch names
  - If result list has fewer than 20 branches: base branch (main/master) must be present
  - If result list has 20 or more branches: base branch (main/master) is optional

          Analyze the output from the 'list_branches_in_repo' tool.

          tool executed: list_branches_in_repo
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - returns a list of branch names
          - conditional requirement for base branch:
            * if result list has fewer than 20 branches: base branch (main or master) MUST be present
            * if result list has 20 or more branches: base branch (main or master) is optional

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any errors?
          3. does the output contain branch names?
          4. how many branches were returned?
          5. if fewer than 20 branches: is the base branch (main or master) present?
          6. if 20 or more branches: test passes regardless of base branch presence

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
