  - File is created in the specified branch
  - Returns confirmation with file path

          Analyze the output from the 'create_file' tool.

          tool executed: create_file
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - file is created in the specified branch
          - returns confirmation with file path

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any errors?
          3. does the output confirm file creation?
          4. is the file path included in the response?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
