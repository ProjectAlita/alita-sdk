  Verify delete_branch tool behavior with and without force flag.
  
  Objective: Test branch deletion workflow with force flag requirement
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Create test branch successfully
  - Delete without force flag returns proper error
  - Branch still exists after failed delete
  - Delete with force flag succeeds
  - Branch no longer exists after forced delete

          Analyze the delete_branch workflow test results.

          Test Branch Name: {test_branch_name}
          
          Step 1 - Create Branch:
          {create_result}
          
          Step 2 - Delete Without Force (should fail with error):
          {delete_without_force_result}
          
          Step 3 - List Branches After Failed Delete:
          {list_after_failed_delete_result}
          
          Step 4 - Delete With Force (should succeed):
          {delete_with_force_result}
          
          Step 5 - List Branches After Successful Delete:
          {list_after_success_delete_result}

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. branch_created: Test branch was created successfully in step 1
          2. delete_without_force_failed: Step 2 returned an error (proper error handling for missing force flag)
          3. error_message_appropriate: Error message indicates force flag is required or branch cannot be deleted
          4. branch_exists_after_failed_delete: Branch name appears in step 3 list results
          5. delete_with_force_succeeded: Step 4 completed successfully without errors
          6. branch_not_exists_after_success_delete: Branch name does NOT appear in step 5 list results

          Expected error patterns for step 2 (delete without force):
          - "force" or "protected" mentioned in error
          - "cannot delete" or "deletion failed"
          - http error codes 400, 403, or 405

          Evaluate each criterion carefully and provide detailed reasoning.

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "branch_created": boolean,
            "delete_without_force_failed": boolean,
            "error_message_appropriate": boolean,
            "branch_exists_after_failed_delete": boolean,
            "delete_with_force_succeeded": boolean,
            "branch_not_exists_after_success_delete": boolean,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          Return ONLY the JSON object.

        type: fixed
        value: []
    output:
      - test_results
    structured_output_dict:
