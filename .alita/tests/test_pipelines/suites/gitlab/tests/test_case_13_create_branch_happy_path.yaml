  Verify create_branch tool creates a new branch in repository.
  
  Objective: Confirm branch creation functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully without errors
  - New branch is created
  - Returns confirmation with branch name

toolkits:
  - id: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_NAME}

state:
  branch_name:
    type: str
    value: feature-test-${TIMESTAMP}
  tool_result:
    type: dict
  test_results:
    type: dict

entry_point: invoke_create_branch

nodes:
  - id: invoke_create_branch
    type: toolkit
    tool: create_branch
    toolkit_name: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_NAME}
    input:
      - branch_name
    input_mapping:
      branch_name:
        type: variable
        value: branch_name
    output:
      - tool_result
    structured_output: true
    transition: process_results

  - id: process_results
    type: llm
    model: gpt-4o-2024-11-20
    input:
      - tool_result
    input_mapping:
      system:
        type: fixed
        value: "You are a quality assurance validator."
      task:
        type: fstring
        value: |
          Analyze the output from the 'create_branch' tool.

          tool executed: create_branch
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - new branch is created in the repository
          - returns confirmation with branch name

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any errors?
          3. does the output confirm branch creation?
          4. is the branch name included in the response?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
      chat_history:
        type: fixed
        value: []
    output:
      - test_results
    structured_output_dict:
      test_results: "dict"
    transition: END
