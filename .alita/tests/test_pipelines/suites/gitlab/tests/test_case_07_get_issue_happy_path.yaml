  - Returns issue details including title and description
  - Issue number matches requested issue

toolkits:
  - id: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_NAME}

  issue_number:
    type: int
    value: ${GITLAB_TEST_ISSUE_NUMBER}
  tool_result:
    type: dict
  test_results:
    type: dict

          Analyze the output from the 'get_issue' tool.

          tool executed: get_issue
          parameters: issue_number={issue_number}
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - returns issue details including title and description
          - issue number matches the requested issue

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any errors?
          3. does the output contain issue details (title, description)?
          4. is the issue data properly structured?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
      chat_history:
        type: fixed
        value: []
    output:
      - test_results
    structured_output_dict:
      test_results: "dict"
    transition: END
