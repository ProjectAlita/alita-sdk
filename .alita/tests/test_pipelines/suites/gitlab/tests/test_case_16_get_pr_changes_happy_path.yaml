description: |
  Verify get_pr_changes tool retrieves merge request diff.
  
  Objective: Test MR diff retrieval functionality (GitLab-specific)
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully without errors
  - Returns diff in git diff format
  - Shows file changes with additions/deletions

toolkits:
  - id: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_ID}
    name: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_NAME}

state:
  pr_number:
    type: int
    value: 1
  tool_result:
    type: dict
  test_results:
    type: dict

entry_point: invoke_get_pr_changes

nodes:
  - id: invoke_get_pr_changes
    type: toolkit
    tool: get_pr_changes
    toolkit_name: ${GITLAB_TOOLKIT_NAME}
    input:
      - pr_number
    input_mapping:
      pr_number:
        type: variable
        value: pr_number
    output:
      - tool_result
    structured_output: true
    transition: process_results

  - id: process_results
    type: llm
    model: gpt-4o-2024-11-20
    input:
      - tool_result
    input_mapping:
      system:
        type: fixed
        value: "You are a quality assurance validator."
      task:
        type: fstring
        value: |
          Analyze the output from the 'get_pr_changes' tool.

          tool executed: get_pr_changes
          parameters: pr_number=1
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - returns diff in git diff format showing file changes
          - includes additions, deletions, and context lines

          note: if the MR does not exist, error handling is acceptable.
          the key is that the tool executes without unexpected system errors.

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute?
          2. if successful, does the output contain diff information?
          3. if there are errors, are they about MR not found (acceptable) or system errors (failure)?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.
      chat_history:
        type: fixed
        value: []
    output:
      - test_results
    structured_output_dict:
      test_results: "dict"
    transition: END
