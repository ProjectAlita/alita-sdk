  Objective: Test file content appending functionality
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Tool executes successfully without errors
  - Content is appended to the end of the file
  - Returns confirmation of append operation

    value: ${GITLAB_TEST_FILE_PATH}
  content:
    type: str
    value: |

          Analyze the output from the 'append_file' tool.

          tool executed: append_file
          results: {tool_result}

          expected behavior:
          - tool executes successfully without errors
          - content is appended to the end of the existing file
          - returns confirmation of append operation

          evaluate:
          1. did the tool execute successfully?
          2. are there any errors?
          3. does the output confirm content was appended?
          4. is the operation confirmed in the response?

          return a json object with:
          {{
            "test_passed": true/false,
            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          return **only** the json object. no markdown formatting, no additional text.

        type: fixed

    output:
