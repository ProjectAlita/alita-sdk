  Verify delete_file tool removes file from repository.
  
  Objective: Test file deletion functionality with self-contained test data
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - Creates unique test branch
  - Creates test file
  - Tool executes successfully without errors
  - File is deleted from the specified branch
  - Returns confirmation of deletion
  - Cleanup removes test branch

          Analyze the output from the 'delete_file' tool execution.

          Branch Creation: {create_branch_result}
          File Creation: {create_file_result}
          Delete Operation: {delete_result}
          Test Branch: {test_branch_name}
          Test File: {test_file_path}

          This is a POSITIVE test - we expect successful file deletion.

          Validation Criteria (ALL must pass for test_passed=true):
          1. branch_created: Test branch was created successfully
          2. file_created: Test file was created successfully
          3. tool_executed: delete_file tool ran and returned results
          4. no_errors: Output does NOT contain error indicators
          5. file_deleted: Output confirms file was deleted successfully
          6. operation_confirmed: Delete operation is confirmed in response

          Return JSON test_results:
          {{
            "test_passed": boolean (true only if ALL criteria pass),
            "branch_created": boolean,
            "file_created": boolean,
            "tool_executed": boolean,
            "no_errors": boolean,
            "file_deleted": boolean,

            "summary": "brief description of outcome",
            "error": "error details if failed, null if passed"
          }}

          Return ONLY the JSON object.
