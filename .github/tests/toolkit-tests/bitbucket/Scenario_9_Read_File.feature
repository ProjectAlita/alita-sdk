Feature: Read file content from Bitbucket repository
  The system must allow users to read file content so that code can be reviewed and analyzed.

  # Original Input Context (preserved)
  # Test name: Tool - Read File
  # Test type: functional
  # Test Data:
  #   Branch: "{{branch_name}}"
  #   File Path: "{{file_path}}"

  Background:
    Given I am an authenticated Bitbucket user with repository access
    And the file "{{file_path}}" exists in branch "{{branch_name}}"

  Scenario: Successfully read file content
    When I read the content of file "{{file_path}}" from branch "{{branch_name}}"
    Then the file content should be retrieved successfully
    And the response should contain the complete file content

  # EXPECTED OUTPUT (preserved):
  # The complete file content displayed in a readable format.
  # The agent should show the file content with proper formatting and syntax highlighting if possible.
