Feature: Create a new file in Bitbucket repository
  The system must allow creation of new files so that code and documentation can be added to the repository.

  # Original Input Context (preserved)
  # Test name: Tool - Create File
  # Test type: functional
  # Test Data:
  #   Branch: "{{branch_name}}"
  #   File Path: {{random_file_path}} - Agent should generate a random file path
  #   Content: JavaScript authentication module

  Background:
    Given I am an authenticated Bitbucket user with repository write access
    And the branch "{{branch_name}}" exists

  Scenario: Successfully create a new file
    Given the agent generates a random file path for the new file
    When I create a file with the generated random path in branch "{{branch_name}}" with content:
      """
      // User Authentication Login Module
      class LoginManager {
        constructor() {
          this.isAuthenticated = false;
        }
        
        async authenticate(username, password) {
          // Authentication logic here
          return this.validateCredentials(username, password);
        }
        
        validateCredentials(username, password) {
          // Validation implementation
          return username && password && username.length > 0;
        }
      }
      
      module.exports = LoginManager;
      """
    Then the file should be created successfully at the generated random path
    And the response should include the actual file path used
    And I can read the file content from the repository using the generated path
    And the file content should match the provided content
    And the file path should be different from any previous test runs

  # EXPECTED OUTPUT (preserved):
  # A confirmation message stating the file was created successfully, including the randomly generated file path.
  # The agent should verify this by successfully reading the file content using the generated path and confirming it matches.
