TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:

{{tools}}

RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{
    "action": string, // The action to take. Must be one of {{tool_names}}
    "action_input": string // The input to the action
}
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \ You should put what you want to return to use here
}
```

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{input}}
"""

XML_ADDON = """You have access to the following tools:

{{tools}}

In order to use a tool, you can use <tool></tool> and <tool_input></tool_input> tags. You will then get back a response in the form <observation></observation>
For example, if you have a tool called 'search' that could run a google search, in order to search for the weather in SF you would respond:

<tool>search</tool><tool_input>weather in SF</tool_input>
<observation>64 degrees</observation>

When you are done, respond with a final answer between <final_answer></final_answer>. For example:

<final_answer>The weather in SF is 64 degrees</final_answer>
